**Overview:**
The overall goal of this project is to explore the relationship between the average daily calorie supply and adult obesity rates across different countries and years. For this project, we will use data from two trusted sources which are the “Total daily supply of calories per person (1961-2022)” dataset from Our World in Data (based on the UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO data) and the “Obesity Among Adults by Country (1975-2016)” dataset from Kaggle (based on World Health Organization WHO data). 
These two datasets come from different, trustworthy sources and have different structures making them suitable for integration and analysis. Together, they will help us see how the total amount of calories available per person per day in a country is related to the percentage of adults who are classified as obese in that country.

**Research questions:**
As mentioned above, this project focuses on understanding the connection between food energy supply and obesity levels across different countries. Therefore, our main research questions are:
Is there a relationship between the average daily calorie supply per person and the adult obesity rate in each country?
Do countries that have more calories available per person tend to have higher obesity rates?
How has the relationship between calorie supply and obesity rates changed across different years or regions?

**Team:**
Tracie Huynh: I will take the lead on finding and preparing the datasets we will use for this project. Once the data is collected, I’ll help Cynthia with cleaning, organizing, and integrating the two datasets into a single and organized file for analysis. I’ll also create visualizations that help show patterns or relationships between calorie supply and obesity rates in different countries and years. In addition, I’ll document each step of our workflow so that our process is clear and easy to follow. I will make sure that we stay on schedule and that our project follows all the course’s requirements and rules. I will also help write and organize the final report to make sure it is complete and clearly explained and ready to submit on time.

**Dataset:**
The first dataset is called “Total Daily Supply of Calories per Person (1961-2022)” from Our World in Data which is based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). It shows the average number of calories available per person per day in each country and year. One thing to remember is this data measures how much food energy people have access to not how much they actually eat. The file is in CSV format and includes columns for country, year, and total calories per person per day. It was downloaded manually by us from the Our World in Data website and is openly available under a Creative Commons license. Since it does not include any personal or sensitive information, we believe there are no ethical concerns when using it.
The second dataset is called “Obesity Among Adults by Country (1975-2016)” from Kaggle which is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) data. It includes the percentage of adults who are obese (with a BMI of 30 or higher) in each country and year. It is also a CSV file with columns for country, year, and obesity rate. It was also downloaded manually by us from Kaggle and is publicly available so there are no privacy or ethical issues.
